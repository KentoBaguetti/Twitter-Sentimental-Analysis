# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis
This program will take tweets and their information (in a certain format) and returns a file
with their information such as the avg sentiment of the tweets, top five countries the tweets are from, 
number of tweets, number of pos/neg/neut/ tweets and more.

The program isnt very clean nor optimized.
I will probably clean it up later and use the panda module later to make it better and show off what I can do
